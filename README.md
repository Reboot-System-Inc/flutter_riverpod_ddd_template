# Flutter Riverpod DDD Template

**Note**: This README will be removed automatically after setup. You can watch the action flow during this time to understand the scenario.

This is a Flutter project template that combines the power of [Riverpod](https://pub.dev/packages/riverpod) for state management and adheres to the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD). The core structure of this template is heavily influenced by [solid-software/flutter_project_template](https://github.com/solid-software/flutter_project_template) and is enhanced with additional features and configurations.

## Features

- **Riverpod for State Management**: Riverpod is used to manage the state of your Flutter application in a clean and efficient manner.

- **DDD Principles**: This template follows Domain-Driven Design principles, helping you organize your codebase in a structured way that reflects your application's domain.

- **Dependency Injection**: Easily inject dependencies using Riverpod's Provider containers.

- **Solid Lints**: This template incorporates [solid_lints](https://pub.dev/packages/solid_lints) to enforce code quality and consistency.

- **CI/CD Integration**: Set up continuous integration (CI) for automated testing and analysis of your project.

- **Latest Flutter Version**: Always uses the latest stable version of Flutter for development.

## Getting Started

To create a Flutter project using this template, follow these steps:

1. **Create a New Repository**: Press "Use this template" on the GitHub menu and fill out the form with your new repository name. Press "Create repository from template."

2. **Wait for Setup**: Wait for the repository to be created and for the initial setup actions to complete. In a few minutes, your Flutter project will be set up with the necessary configurations.

3. **Clone and Code**: Clone the repository to your local development environment and start coding. You'll have a well-structured Flutter project with Riverpod for state management and DDD principles to guide you.

## Template Source

The core structure of this project template is derived from the [Reboot-System-Inc/demo](https://github.com/Reboot-System-Inc/demo) repository, which serves as a robust boilerplate project following DDD and Riverpod practices.

## Credits

This template draws inspiration from [solid-software/flutter_project_template](https://github.com/solid-software/flutter_project_template) and aims to provide a similar level of code quality and project organization while adding the power of Riverpod and DDD to your Flutter projects.

Feel free to customize and extend this template to suit your specific project requirements and preferences. Happy coding!
